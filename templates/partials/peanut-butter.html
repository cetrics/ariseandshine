          <p>
            Peanut butter processing at Arise and Shine CBO is more than just a
            vocational skill—it is a lifeline for caregivers of children with
            disabilities. In a region where economic challenges often prevent
            families from accessing quality care and resources, this program
            provides a sustainable source of income while allowing caregivers to
            remain present in their children’s lives. Many of these children
            require consistent attention, therapy, and special accommodations,
            which makes formal employment difficult for their guardians. By
            training caregivers in peanut butter production using locally
            sourced peanuts, Arise and Shine equips them to produce, package,
            and sell a nutritious product that is already in high demand within
            local markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The impact of this initiative extends far beyond income generation.
            It fosters independence, dignity, and self-worth among caregivers
            who may have once felt isolated or powerless. Participating in
            peanut butter production gives them not only a skill but also a
            renewed sense of purpose. The training sessions are designed to be
            inclusive and empowering, bringing together caregivers from diverse
            backgrounds to learn, share, and support one another. This sense of
            community reduces the emotional burden of caregiving and helps erase
            the stigma often associated with raising children who have special
            needs. In turn, children benefit directly from better nutrition,
            improved home environments, and a more emotionally supported
            caregiver.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, Arise and Shine CBO envisions scaling this program
            into a fully operational peanut butter manufacturing company. This
            expansion will open doors to employment for even more caregivers
            while creating a steady revenue stream to fund additional therapy,
            education, and disability support services. The initiative is a
            perfect example of the organization's core values—empowerment,
            inclusivity, and community participation—translated into action. By
            investing in peanut butter processing, Arise and Shine is not only
            lifting individual families but also nourishing a culture of
            resilience, enterprise, and hope for children with disabilities
            across Kericho and beyond.
